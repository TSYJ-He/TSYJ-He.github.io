## About Me


I‚Äôm currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. Since the summer of 2024, I have had the privilege of being supervised by several esteemed professors: Prof. <a href="https://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/author/bowen-zhou/">Bowen Zhou</a>¬† and Prof. <a href="https://www.stingning.cn/">Ning Ding</a> at the Shanghai AI Lab; Prof. <a href="https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/People/Full_time_PI/Alex_Lamb.htm">Alex Lamb</a> at the College AI; Prof. <a href="https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangyu/en/index.htm">Yu Wang</a> at the Nanoscale Integrated Circuits and System Lab; and Prof. <a href="https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/#faculty">Yong Li</a> at the Future Intelligence Lab.

Currently I am working on theories and scalable methods for developing reasoning intelligence. I am also interested in learning models in abstract spaces, investigating how AI represents the world.
